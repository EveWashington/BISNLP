I shared a triple with 2 other girls, and since it would be too cramped for him to spend the night in my room, we felt it best to hang out and sleep in one of the downstairs lounges. I had seen many students sleep in the lounge before after a drunken night with friends. At around 3 AM, we were awakened by the Public Safety officers “responding to a call of unauthorized trespassers.” Once they verified my student ID, they left. A couple weeks later, one of my friends told me who made the call. That person said that he had never seen either of us before and wanted to make sure we weren’t lost. Considering the large homeless population in the area, he wanted to ensure that we’d get back safe to wherever we were from. Then he laughed it off with his friends. As it was the first month of school, it makes sense that we didn’t know each other. It is impossible to enter the building without ID. I just question if he would have had called DPS had there been two white people in that lounge. His name is [redacted], and he currently has a host of defunding resources in his instagram bio.

I eventually went to the head coach about what I was experiencing and he assured me the matter would be addressed. I came to find out the matter was “handled” by the head coach having a singular 15 minute meeting with some members of the men’s team about their behavior. After said meeting I was accused by the individual at the center of the hate speech and harassment of “trying to derail his life and his future” by coming forward. There was no follow up conversation, no disciplinary action, no further discourse or inquiry, no anything after that meeting. I went to President Paxson’s open office hours about the issue and how it needed to be addressed and she looked me in my face and asked me what “I was going to do to fix the problem” which threw me off because I was unprepared for the leader of the University to put the issue back on me.

The first half of the class had a South Asian interim professor. During one of the first classes, we discussed a piece of work from an Enlightenment thinker. I brought up the fact that this Enlightenment thinker was integral to the construction of race and post-enlightenment justifications for slavery, and thus we should consider the piece through that context. This professor had a habit of cutting me off mid-thought and hoarding class time to “de-racialize” discussion. This time was no different, as he asked me to “remove race“ from my analysis. I pushed back, saying you cannot remove race from these discussions, especially when discussing the architects of modern racial hierarchy. He responded that this Enlightenment thinker was not “KKK” racist, therefore “not as bad” and implied that we should engage with the piece in a more positive manner.

I was always scared of going to office hours like other students for fear of being seen as “less.” That year I overcame my fear and reached out to the Professor. With their guidance and faith in me (shout out to Professor Ni), I turned my struggle around and scored 100 on one of our problem sets. 

My grade was published while sitting next to my white friend during a shift at my job. Excited, I turned around and told her I got a 100 on my pset. Looking me straight in the eye and laughing, she said “Oh, the one you copied off of Lexi!” [an Asian student]

She did not know what class this grade was in.  
She did not realize that Lexi was not in this class.  
She did not take note that Lexi and I have always equally collaborated in all our past work efforts. 

She believed that if I ever scored 100 on a problem set, I must have cheated off a non-Black student. That there was no way for me to do it on my own. And she had no problem voicing that assertion in my work place, with my boss nearby. 

To this day, I am not fully comfortable around this woman--a future doctor. How can you move forward with someone who has no respect for you? Who you know will never fully understand the gravity of what they did and why it was wrong?

Immediately we noticed our TA would routinely give our pset answers lower scores, even though we had the same answers as other students (of course with small differences in phrasing). 

It may seem silly fighting over points, but this was premed and this was Harvard. The standards for med school were still high, but the curve was small. Everyone was fighting to break out of the B+ bubble. 

One day I confronted my TF and pushed her to answer why I had gotten 0 points on a question when my answer was no different than another student who got full marks. For some reason that day I was relentless and didn’t let her have any easy outs. Maybe it was because I was tired. Tired of having my essay drafts be used as model examples in expos but still ending up with a B+. Tired of Professors and students looking down on me even though I was more than capable. Tired of all the bullshit. 

That day she admitted my answer was the same. When I asked her how many points she would return to me, she looked at me and said “1/4.” My jaw dropped. Seeing that, she said maybe 1/2. This question was several points. 

My other Black friend got fed up and wrote a scathing email to the TA heads. Of course, that led to the course staff committing themselves to failing his assignments. We ended the course with a B- and C+ respectively. Perhaps that was the beginning of the end of our premed dreams",
